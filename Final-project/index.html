                            AI-driven imposter scams have evolved dramatically over the past few years. New technologies have made it easier to trick individuals into transferring funds or other sensitive information under false pretenses.
                        </p>
                        <p>Leveraging artificial intelligence to swindle unsuspecting victims has become easier than ever. Scammers can use text-to-speech, voice cloning and spoofing technology to create scam calls impersonating government officials, businesses or even loved ones.</p>
                        <p>I created the scam call above using easily available technology I found on the internet to clone my own voice. It replicates what older Americans may hear when targeted by a “grandparent scam” capitalizing on emotional distress to garner funds. It took only an hour to create.</p>

            <p>Imposter scams, which incude any type of impersonation to garner money from victims under false pretenses, are the most lucrative and popular scam category in the U.S. In 2024, Maryland emerged as number three in the United States in per capita reports of imposter scams during the first three quarters of the year, according to the Federal Trade Commission. Over the past five years, the number of imposter scams has been on a consistent upward trajectory in all 50 states, posing significant threats to residents across the state and country.</p>

                    <p>In 2023, victims reported losing over 2,707 million dollars due to imposter scams. However, according to the FTC, the amount of total losses is likely much higher as victims are often reluctant to report scams due to shame, embarrassment or fear of judgment. </p>
                    <p>From 2020 to 2023 the FTC reported a 36 percent increase in the number of imposter scam reports across the state of Maryland. </p>
                    <p>AI has provided scammers with more sophisticated tools to target victims. AI-driven technologies enable criminals to create highly convincing voice clones using audio sourced from social media or even other scam calls. Scammers also use existing repositories of voice models to cloak their voices when impersonating officials or businesses, making them harder for law enforcement to track down. </p>
                    <p>In the context of grandparent scams, AI plays a pivotal role. These scams typically involve fraudsters posing as grandchildren in distress from car accidents, assaults or recent arrests seeking urgent financial assistance. By using AI-generated voices that mimic a victim's family member, scammers evoke emotional responses that victims into acting fast, leaving them without the time to consider they may be being scammed.</p>

                            <p>One California man experienced the real-world dangers of AI in fraudulent schemes firsthand. As reported by ABC7 News, it started when he received a call from someone who sounded exactly like his son, claiming to have struck and critically injured a pregnant woman. </p>
                            <p>The short call made the man, only identified as Anthony, not hesitate when soon after he received a call from a different man claiming to be his son's lawyer. The man asked Anthony for $9,200 for his son's bail. Then for $25,000, saying the woman had died and the bail had been raised.</p>

                <section class="additional-paragraphs mb-5">
                    <p> It was only after Anthony had withdrawn and delivered the money that he learned the horrifying truth: the call had been a scam. Using AI-powered voice cloning, scammers had replicated his son's voice. The scammers likely gathered audio samples from social media or other public platforms, then used the recordings to train a voice model for the deception (ABC7 News, October 2024).</p>
                    <p>The scammers capitalized on age, fear and urgency to defraud him of thousands of dollars.</p>

            <p>Creating an AI voice clone requires only a few steps. First, scammers collect voice samples, often from social media posts or other publicly available recordings. They then use AI tools to train models capable of mimicking a person’s unique vocal patterns, tone, and speech nuances. Once the clone is ready, the scammers deploy it during calls, often in conjunction with phone spoofing, to create a seamless and convincing interaction.</p>
            <p>Spoofing allows scammers to disguise their caller ID, making it appear as though the call is coming from a legitimate source, such as a government agency or a familiar phone number. These calls further bypass the initial skepticism of potential victims, increasing the likelihood of a successful scam.</p>
            <p>Scammers are also impersonating banks and business associates with alarming frequency. These schemes often begin with a call that appears to come from a financial institution’s official number, warning the recipient of suspicious activity on their account. Victims are then prompted to confirm personal or banking information under the guise of “securing” their funds. In other cases, scammers pretend to be colleagues or business partners, requesting urgent wire transfers or access to sensitive documents. </p>
            <p>AI-generated calls. The rules would create the framework to better legislate against using AI technologies to commit fraud. Still, for Amy Nofziger, director of fraud victim support at AARP Fraud Watch Network, the best way to combat these new scams is to lean on old advice: stay familiar with tactics, keep on guard and don't be afraid to report.</p>
            <h4 class="fw-bold"> “Just listen to what they’re asking for,” </h4>
                <p>Nofziger told the New York Times in August.</p>
                <h4 class="fw-bold"> “If anyone is asking you for prepaid gift cards, Bitcoin via ATM machines, gold bars, cash, Venmo, CashApp, Zelle or Social Security numbers or Medicare information, stop.”</h4>
