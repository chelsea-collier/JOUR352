            <p>Koi, or more specifically Nishikigoi, are colored varieties of carp (Cyprinus sp.) that are kept for decorative purposes in outdoor koi ponds or water gardens.</p>
            <p>Koi is an informal name for the colored variants of carp kept for ornamental purposes. There are many varieties of ornamental koi, originating from breeding that began in Niigata, Japan in the early 19th century.</p>
            <p>Several varieties are recognized by Japanese breeders and owners, distinguished by coloration, patterning, and scalation. Some of the major colors are white, black, red, orange, yellow, blue, brown and cream, besides metallic shades like gold and silver-white ('platinum') scales. The most popular category of koi is the Gosanke, which is made up of the Kōhaku, Taishō Sanshoku and Shōwa Sanshoku varieties.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Carp are a large group of fish originally found in Central Europe and Asia. Various carp species were originally domesticated in China, where they were used as food fish. Carp are coldwater fish, and their ability to survive and adapt to many climates and water conditions allowed the domesticated species to be propagated to many new locations, including Japan.</p>
            <img src="img/koi-fish.jpg" alt="Koi fish in a pond">
            <p>In Japan, Miocene fossils of the carp family (Cyprinidae) have been excavated from Iki Island in Nagasaki Prefecture.[4] In addition, numerous carp pharyngeal teeth have been excavated from Jomon and Yayoi period sites.[5] For example, pharyngeal teeth of the extinct species Jōmon Koi (Cyprinus sp.) in addition to the modern species of carp (Cyprinus carpio or Cyprinus rubrofuscus) have been excavated from the Akanoi Bay lakebed site (赤野井湾湖底遺跡) in Lake Biwa at the end of the Early Jomon Period (11,500 – 7,000 years ago).[5] In addition, pharyngeal teeth of all six subfamilies of the Cyprinidae family living in Japan today, including carp (Cyprinus), have been found at the Awazu lakebed site (粟津湖底遺跡) dating from the Middle Jomon Period (5500 – 4400 years ago).[5]</p>
            <p>There are differences in the length distribution of carp excavated from Jomon and Yayoi sites, as estimated from the size of their pharyngeal teeth. Specifically, not only adult carp but also juvenile carp (less than 150 mm in length) have been found at the Yayoi site. This difference is thought to be due to the fact that the Jomon only collected carp from lakes and rivers, while the Yayoi cultivated primitive carp along with the spread of rice paddies.[5][6]</p>
            <p>It was previously thought that all Japanese carp were introduced from China in prehistoric times.[7] However, recent analysis of mitochondrial DNA revealed a significant evolutionary divergence (phylogenetic split) within common carp Cyprinus carpio between the native wild form found in Lake Biwa and the Eurasian wild form, along with domesticated varieties. This supports the idea of the ancient origin of the native Japanese form (Cyprinus sp.), as well as the East Asian ancient lineage of wild common carp (C. carpio), previously proposed on the basis of fossil data. However, it is unknown when the carp from the continent was introduced to Japan. In addition, a possible multiple origin of koi carp was indicated by the polyphyletic distribution of five mtDNA haplotypes of koi carp within the ‘Eurasian’ clade.[8] Moreover, the oldest record of the introduction of non-native fish in Japan is that of goldfish from China (1502 or 1602),[9] and there is no record of carp (including colored carp) until the introduction of the mirror carp, called Doitsugoi (German carp), in 1904.[10]</p>

            <h2>In the wild</h2>

            <p>Koi have been accidentally or deliberately released into the wild in every continent except Antarctica. They quickly revert to the natural coloration of an Amur carp within a few generations. In many areas, they are considered an invasive species and a pest. In the states of Queensland and New South Wales in Australia, they are considered noxious fish.[66][67]</p>
            <p>Koi greatly increase the turbidity of the water because they are constantly stirring up the substrate. This makes waterways unattractive, reduces the abundance of aquatic plants, and can render the water unsuitable for swimming or drinking, even by livestock. In some countries, koi have caused so much damage to waterways that vast amounts of money and effort have been spent trying to eradicate them, largely unsuccessfully.[68]</p>
            <p>In many areas of North America, koi are introduced into the artificial "water hazards" and ponds on golf courses to keep water-borne insect larvae under control through predation.</p>

            <h2>In common culture</h2>
            <p>In Japan, the koi is a symbol of luck, prosperity, and good fortune, and also of perseverance in the face of adversity.[69] Ornamental koi are symbolic of Japanese culture and are closely associated with the country's national identity.[70] The custom of koinobori (carp streamers), which began in the Edo period (1603–1867), is still practiced today and displayed in gardens on Children's Day, 5 May.[71]</p>
            <p>In Chinese culture, the koi represents fame, family harmony, and wealth. It is a feng shui favorite, symbolizing abundance as well as perseverance and strength, and has a mythical potential to transform into a dragon.[72] Since the late 20th century, the keeping of koi in outdoor water gardens has become popular among the more affluent Chinese. Koi ponds are found in Chinese communities around the world, and the number of people who keep koi imported from Niigata, has been increasing. In addition, there are increasing numbers of Japanese koi bred in China that are sold domestically and exported to foreign countries.[31][32]</p>
            <p>Koi are also popular in many countries in the equatorial region, where outdoor water gardens are popular.[73] In Sri Lanka, interior courtyards most often have one or several fish ponds dedicated to koi.[74]</p>
