            <h3>The Birth of Southern Slang</h3>
            <p>As a fan of hip-hop etymology, I looked for Outkast's role as potential inventors of slang. Turns out that there’s definitely a case for Outkast's first use of "crunk" and "skeet."</p>
            <p>What I never realized is that this is consistent with Outkast’s position as the face of southern hip-hop – "crunk" and "skeet" both originated from the South. Southern themes in hip-hop are intimately connected to Outkast's legacy.</p>
            <p>Here's why: before Outkast, southern hip-hop was jokingly called “country s---” by east/west-coast constituencies. People began to take the South more seriously when Outkast won the ’95 Source award for best new group. During the acceptance speech, the east/west-coast’s lack of respect for the South revealed itself in the form of boos from the audience.</p>
            <p>Big Boi paid tribute to New York and “all the original MCs,” but Andre decided to rant, "I’m tired of the close-minded folks. We got a demo tape and no one wants to hear it. But the south got something to say—that’s all I got to say."</p>

            <h3>Outkast's Southern Sound: ATL Strip Clubs, Guitar Riffs, and Aliens</h3>
            <p>Beyond ATL slang, Outkast’s first four albums contain copious drawl and references to Atlanta (strip clubs, projects, neighborhoods, intersections, Cadillacs), creating a sound that was distinctly southern.</p>
            <p>There are countless anecdotes that Atlanta was absolutely captivated by Outkast's early music. Their music was heard on every street-corner and from cars driving by. Intersections and businesses referenced in the songs gained popularity. There’s even evidence of Puff Daddy directing Playa’s Ball (Outkast’s first single in ’94) and bringing Kangol hats back to NYC.</p>
            <p>Outkast's sound became even more distinct when they began producing their own music on ATLiens (their second album). These self-produced songs are about aliens, stars, and Nuwabian Nation—just about as far as you can get from the glorification of pimps, guns, and drugs (east/west-coast themes).</p>
