        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 medium cucumbers, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the sliced cucumbers in a colander and sprinkle them with kosher salt. Let them sit for about 10 minutes to draw out excess moisture.</li>
            <li>Rinse the cucumbers under cold water to remove the salt, and then pat them dry with a clean towel.</li>
            <li>In a large jar with a tight-fitting lid, combine the sugar, rice vinegar, sesame oil, and red pepper flakes (if using).</li>
            <li>Add the cucumbers and cilantro to the jar, close the lid tightly, and shake vigorously to combine all the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Let the salad sit for a few minutes to allow the flavors to meld, then serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p><b>This salad can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 day. The cucumbers may lose some of their crunch over time, but the flavor will still be delicious!</p></b>
